Hello Microbiome Enthusiasts!

DAWG members created this respository so that we can have discussions under "Issues" regarding any problems that you may have while you are working with amplicon sequence datasets. <br/>
Feel free to also post if you have general questions regarding certain steps or which parameters to pass and why. <br/>
We are here to help and further facilitate the exceptional microbiome related research at Penn State.  <br/><br/>To participate, you'll need to create a profile.  <br/><br/>Once created, please see the "Issues" tab.
